systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. 

It is designed to manage the startup and management of system processes, daemons, services, and other system resources, as well as to provide a range of other system management and configuration features. 

Systemd is the default init system for many Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, and others. It is responsible for starting and stopping system services, tracking and logging system events, managing system resources, and providing a unified system management interface.
