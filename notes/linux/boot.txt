An init system is a program that is responsible for initializing and managing the core services and processes of an operating system during the boot process. 

The init system is typically the first process started during boot, and it is responsible for starting all other system services and daemons.

In addition to managing system services, an init system also provides a mechanism for managing the system's runlevel, which determines which services are started during boot and which are stopped. 

An init system also provides a way to manage system processes, including starting, stopping, and restarting them.

The init system has evolved over time, and there are now several different init systems in use, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Some of the most popular init systems in use today include Systemd, SysVinit, Upstart, and OpenRC.
