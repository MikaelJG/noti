mysqldump -u username -p password dbname > /path/to/backup.sql

mysqldump is a command-line utility in Linux used to generate backups of MySQL databases. It creates a dump file that contains SQL statements needed to recreate the database. The dump file can be used to transfer the database to a different server, archive the database, or create backups that can be used to restore the database in case of data loss. The command is typically used in conjunction with a scheduling tool like cron to automate regular backups.

# Compress the backup file
gzip /path/to/backup.sql
