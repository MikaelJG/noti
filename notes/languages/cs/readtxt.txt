In C#, you can read the content of a file using the File.ReadAllText method or the StreamReader class. Here is an example of how you can read a file using File.ReadAllText:

using System;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string fileName = args[0];
        string fileContent = File.ReadAllText(fileName);
        Console.WriteLine(fileContent);
    }
}

This code reads the content of the file specified in the command-line arguments and outputs it to the console. If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can use the > operator in the command prompt. For example, to save the output to a file named "output.txt", you can use the following command:

lua

program.exe file.txt > output.txt

This will run the program, read the content of the "file.txt" file, and save it to the "output.txt" file.
