Keyring
A "stored database" -- I'm using this term lightly -- of your login information stored on your local PC.
It's encrypted by a schema (PKCS#11 - used for secure storage on removable media).
Thus it's relatively secure from prying eyes.

It provides a common backend for (a framework like gnome for an exe) to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) your login info
It keeps a consistent interface for programmers utilizing that particular framework.
KDE provides its own keyring, Gnome has another implementation of it.
