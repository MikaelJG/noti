Merge takes all the changes in one branch and merges them into another branch in one commit.

Rebase says I want the point at which I branched to move to a new starting point

Merge

you have created a feature branch. When you want to bring those changes back to master, you probably want merge.

$ git checkout master
$ git merge cool-feature

Rebase

you developed when another developer made an unrelated change. You probably want to pull and then rebase to base your changes from the current version of repo.

avoid spaghetti-history you can rebase:

git checkout master
git merge cool-feature
