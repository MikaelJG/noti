First off, thanks for taking the time. I truly appreciate it. 

language folders should have txt files with :

variables, 

conditionals,

loops, 
for, while, for every in array...

install (how to install and compile code, if needed)

how to take arguments from the command line.

CRUD (create, read, update and delete) variables. 

------------------------------

please create many txt files with your examples, 

ex: if.txt, else.txt, elsif.txt, condition.txt, conditional.txt .... should be the same example with many names!
