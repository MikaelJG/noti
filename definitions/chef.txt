Progress Chef (formerly Chef)
A configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. 
It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration "recipes". 

Chef is used to streamline the task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, OpenStack, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace to automatically provision and configure new machines.
