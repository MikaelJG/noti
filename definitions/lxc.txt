Linux Containers (LXC) 
An operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a control host using a single Linux kernel.
Early versions of Docker used LXC as the container execution driver, though LXC was made optional in v0.9 and support was dropped in Docker v1.10.
References to Linux containers commonly refer to Docker containers running on Linux.
