GitHub Actions 
A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform
It allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. 
You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository.
