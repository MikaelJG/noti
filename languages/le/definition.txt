Less 
Leaner Style Sheets; LESS is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language.
It can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and run on the client side or server side.
Less is influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its CSS-like block formatting syntax.
